## 2. Ease of Use for Beginners

### Scikit-learn
**Advantages:**
- **Simple API**: Consistent interface across all algorithms
- **Minimal Setup**: Works out-of-the-box with basic Python knowledge
- **Clear Documentation**: Excellent tutorials and examples
- **Interpretable Results**: Easy to understand model outputs and feature importance
- **No GPU Required**: Runs on CPU, accessible to all users

**Learning Curve:**
```python
# Example: Training a classifier in 3 lines
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
```

**Challenges:**
- Limited to traditional ML algorithms
- No support for deep learning
- Manual feature engineering required

### TensorFlow
**Advantages:**
- **High-level APIs**: Keras integration makes it more accessible
- **Comprehensive Ecosystem**: Complete solution from research to production
- **Flexibility**: Can build any type of neural network architecture
- **Pre-trained Models**: Access to state-of-the-art models

**Learning Curve:**
```python
# Example: Building a simple neural network
import tensorflow as tf
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

**Challenges:**
- **Steeper Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of neural networks
- **Hardware Requirements**: Benefits from GPU acceleration
- **Complex Debugging**: Harder to debug compared to traditional ML
- **Black Box Nature**: Less interpretable than classical ML models
